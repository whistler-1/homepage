# Welcome to the ReadMe

If you're reading this, you've either found my github, or gone snooping 
through the files on my website - either way, welcome! 

I'm writing this doc before the creation of the github repo - 
I made this website originally about a year ago, but haven't found
much time to work on it. I've got the files back on my laptop again,
hoping that I can work on it a little without distracting me 
from exams too much.
