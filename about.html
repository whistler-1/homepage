    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p> 
        I'm 26 years old, doing my bachelor's at OsloMet. I love learning new things, 
        problem solving, and tinkering with software.

        I enjoy delving into new random topics, like niche languages or roleplaying games. 
        I love capturing a view with my camera and having it turn out just as it looked to 
        me in the moment, or subtly editing if it didn't turn out how I imagined.

        Recent interests: <br>
        I've recently started using Debian on my work laptop and have enjoyed 
        the experience so far. The UI is nice, and there's something very 
        satisfying about using the terminal to solve a problem.

        I spent a couple months early this year trying to learn a constructed language 
        called Toki Pona. It's a really neat project started by linguist Sonja Lang.
        The language only has around 130 words, so communication is often done
        by describing what you're talking about instead of naming it - leading to 
        a lot of subjectivity. For example: as there is no word for "car", a 
        driver might call it a "tomo tawa" (moving room), and someone injured by a car 
        might call it a "kiwen utala" (hard thing that hits you). I got to the
        point where i could slowly read and write basic stuff, but stopped
        when school got more hectic.
